# Predicting House Prices: Data Analysis, Regression, and Model Evaluation  

## Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python assignment**.  
The chosen topic is **Predicting House Prices: Data Analysis, Regression, and Model Evaluation**, which focuses on exploring housing datasets, performing regression analysis, and evaluating models to predict house prices.  

## Steps Followed  
1. Imported and explored the housing dataset.  
2. Cleaned and prepared the data (handling missing values, feature selection, encoding).  
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
4. Applied regression techniques to model house prices.  
5. Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.  
6. Compared results to identify the best-performing model.
